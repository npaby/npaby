1 Roar!! 🦉 Oh-lee here!

2 An aspiring software engineer, learning full-stack development one bug at a time;

3 Lately I’ve been especially into C# and .NET, plus the usual web stuff;

4 Right now I’m collecting skills like side quests and trying to level up one bug at a time;

5 Sometimes I win. Sometimes the semicolon wins—just like this one

6 I like building small things… and guess who just broke most of his code in the process;

7 Always investigating why my code works perfectly once and then suddenly acts like we’ve never met;

8 I also enjoy refactoring because apparently I love fixing problems I just created yesterday;

9 If you see me experimenting here, that’s just me learning out loud;

10 If not, I’m probably somewhere else taking a dramatic cooldown about line 5;
